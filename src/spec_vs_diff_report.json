  "summary": "REQ-10 partially implemented: the header logo <img> src was updated to the requested generated asset and kept at h-10 w-auto, but additional non-logo header/layout/theme-toggle changes were also made, violating the constraint to only modify the selected <img> element and keep other header elements unchanged.",
